This project is a web-based tool that generates personalized business ideas using AI. Users enter their skills, interests, location, and budget, and the system returns a tailored business idea.

It uses React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, OpenAI GPT-4 for idea generation, and Pinecone for semantic search with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Data is stored in PostgreSQL, and the app is designed for easy deployment with platforms like Vercel and Render.
